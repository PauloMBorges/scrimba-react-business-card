# Scrimba React Digital Business Card

This project is a digital business card (static page) built from scratch as part of the [Scrimba's Learn React course](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e).
It was also my first full developed project using React, in which I learned the basics of React, such as setting up, components, JSX syntax and 
deploying to Github Pages.
